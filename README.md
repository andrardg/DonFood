DonFood

DonFood is an app used on one side by restaurants to post food that they want to donate and on the other side by ONGs, who will place orders on the donations and go pick it up in order to distribute the food.

The restaurant and the ong accounts are centralised in a single Account entity in order to optimise information during login and register.

The project is written in Java Spring Boot and it uses JPA and Hybernate for a code first approach.

The project has unit tests established for all services.
